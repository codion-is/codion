[#_adding_a_print_action]
== Adding a print action

The most common place to add a custom control is the table popup menu, i.e. an action for printing reports or for acting on the selected rows. For the simplest case, where a single print action is required, a custom control can be associated with the *PRINT* ControlCode, this control will appear in the Print submenu in the table popup menu as well as on the table toolbar.

For more complex cases, where multiple print controls are required,*createPrintMenuControls()* can be overridden.
