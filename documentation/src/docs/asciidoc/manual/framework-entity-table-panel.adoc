[#_adding_a_print_action]
== Adding a print action

The most common place to add a custom control is the table popup menu, i.e. an action for printing reports. The table popup menu is based on the ControlList returned by the **getPopupControls()** method in the EntityTablePanel class which in turn uses the ControlList returned by the **getPrintControls()** method in the same class for constructing the print popup submenu. So, to add a custom print action you override the **getPrintControls()** method and return a ControlSet containing the action.
