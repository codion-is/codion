Each table has an associated search panel, which can be displayed by using the button highlighted in the screenshot below.
This button toggles through the available search panel views; *hidden*, *simple* and *advanced*.

NOTE: Text based condition fields are by default *Case-Insensitive* and the *EQUAL* and *NOT EQUAL* fields have *automatic wildcard prefix and postfixes*. The automatic wildcards have been disabled for the demonstration below. These can be configured via the condition field popup dialog. The application remembers the field configuration in user preferences.

By default, column condition operators are set to *EQUAL* and foreign keys to *IN*, to change the operator you can use the kbd:[Ctrl + UP / DOWN] keyboard shortcut (the operator is displayed in a tooltip) or switch to the *advanced* search panel view, see below.

NOTE: On macOS, use kbd:[⌘] (Command) instead of kbd:[Ctrl] for keyboard shortcuts.

In the screenshot below we have added a wildcard condition to the *Name* column, using the *%* character as a wildcard.

NOTE: The condition is automatically enabled when a value has been entered.

When the search condition has changed, as in, when it does not represent the data currently in the table, the refresh button in the lower left corner becomes enabled, indicating that a refresh is in order.
Further conditions can be added before a refresh is performed.

There are multiple ways of refreshing the table data:

* Pressing the kbd:[Enter] key with the focus somewhere on the condition panel
* Using the aformentioned refresh button or the kbd:[F5] keyboard shortcut
* Using the *Refresh* action in the table popup menu, or its kbd:[Alt + R] keyboard shortcut
* Using the *Refresh* button on the edit panel, if one is available, or its kbd:[Alt + R] keyboard shortcut

After the table has been refreshed, the refresh button becomes disabled, indicating that the table data represents the current search condition.

NOTE: You can tell a condition is enabled by its BOLD header and shaded column.

Adding a condition to the *Genre* column.

With multiple conditions enabled, all of them are included next time the table is refreshed.

image::search/search_string_wildcard_and_selection.png[Search,string wildcard and selection]

Enabling the *advanced* condition panel view, in order to change the *Name* condition to *NOT EQUAL*.

image::search/search_string_wildcard_negated_and_selection.png[Search,string wildcard negated and selection]

Adding a *LESS THAN* condition to the *Price* column.

image::search/search_string_wildcard_negated_number_less_and_selection.png[Search,string wildcard negated,number less and selection]

Changing the *Price* condition to *GREATER THAN OR EQUAL*.

image::search/search_string_wildcard_negated_number_greater_or_equal_than_and_selection.png[Search,string wildcard negated,number greater or equal and selection]

Changing the *Price* condition to *BETWEEN* and the *Genre* condition to *NOT EQUAL*.

image::search/search_string_wildcard_negated_number_between_and_selection_negated.png[Search,string wildcard negated,number between and selection]

Adding a *NOT EQUAL* condition to the *Composer* column with an empty value.

image::search/search_string_wildcard_negated_number_between_selection_negated_and_not_null.png[Search,string wildcard negated,number between,selection and not null]

NOTE: When searching for empty values, the condition must be manually enabled, since it's only enabled automatically when a non-empty value is entered.

NOTE: To clear all column conditions use the *Search* -> *Clear* action in the table popup menu.
This clears all values and resets all operators to their defaults *EQUAL* for columns and *IN* for foreign keys.

== Keyboard shortcuts

NOTE: On macOS, use kbd:[⌘] (Command) instead of kbd:[Ctrl] for all shortcuts listed below. For example, kbd:[Ctrl + F] becomes kbd:[⌘ + F] on macOS.
