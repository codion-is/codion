The Codion Server Monitor provides a way to monitor the Codion remote server.

Below are screenshots of the different server monitor tabs, after ~1 1/2 hours of running the <<{basedir}/tutorials/chinook.adoc#_load_test, Chinook load test>>, with ~5 minutes of ramping up. The server is running on a Raspberry Pi 4, Ubuntu 18.04, JDK 14, using a https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[HikariCP] connection pool on top of an http://h2database.com/[H2] in-memory database.
