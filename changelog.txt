  EntityPanel.handleSave uses tableModel.getSelectionModel().isSelectionEmpty() instead of EntityModel.isActiveEntityNull, which does not really work for non-trivial primary keys

  PostgreSQL table status query disabled since the function greatest is missing
  FrameworkSettings now Map based, useQueryRange now defaults to false
  Fixed a serious bug in Entity.getReferencedKey, where key values were cached on entityID instead of Property, fu**ing up the case where a table referenced the same table more than once

  EntityPanel.setDetailPanelState() now hides all child detail panels if the state is changing from DIALOG
  Entity.isValueNull() fixed, it returned a false positive for Property.NonDbProperty values, since it only relied on Entity.getRawValue() which circumvents the EntityProxy, which handles NonDbProperties
