# Contributing to Codion

Thank you for your interest in contributing — it means a lot. Here’s what you should know before getting started.

## Code Contributions

Codion may be dual-licensed (GPL + commercial) in the future. Because of this, I will require copyright
assignment for all code contributions. The infrastructure for this isn't in place yet, but will be added if and when it becomes necessary.

Until then, feel free to fork, explore, and share feedback — but no pull requests just yet.

## Bug Reports

Bug reports are very welcome and appreciated.

- Please specify the Codion version you’re using.
- Be as detailed as possible in describing the issue.
- If feasible, include a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org) — a Short, Self-Contained, Correct Example.

## Translations

There’s plenty of localization work available for those interested.

For an overview of localizable messages, see the `technical/i18n` section in the documentation.

## Documentation Requests

The documentation is a work in progress. If something is unclear, missing, or needs improvement, feel free to open an issue — I’ll prioritize based on demand.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome — with a note of caution:

Codion is mostly feature-complete by design. I may be very selective about new feature inclusion to preserve its simplicity and focus. That said, good ideas are always worth discussing.

Thanks again for taking the time to explore Codion and help improve it.
