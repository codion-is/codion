# Contributing to Codion

Thank you for your interest in contributing — it means a lot. Here's what you should know before getting started.

## Code Contributions Not Accepted

**Codion is "open-source, not open-contribution."** Code contributions (pull requests) are not currently accepted.

This policy allows for tight control over the codebase architecture, design decisions, and quality standards while the framework is being finalized.

**Pull requests will be closed without detailed code review** to avoid copyright complications. Trivial changes (typos in documentation, obvious syntax errors) may be incorporated at the maintainer's discretion with acknowledgment.

**If and when code contributions are accepted in the future**, copyright assignment will be required. This is because Codion may be dual-licensed (GPL + commercial) down the road, which requires clear ownership of all contributions.

In the meantime, you're welcome to:
- Fork the project for your own use
- Explore the codebase and share feedback
- Report bugs and suggest solutions (see below)

## Bug Reports

Bug reports are very welcome and appreciated.

- Please specify the Codion version you're using.
- Be as detailed as possible in describing the issue.
- If feasible, include a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org) — a Short, Self-Contained, Correct Example.

**Please do not submit bug fixes as pull requests.** Instead, open an issue describing the problem with reproduction steps. Maintainers will handle the implementation.

## Suggesting Solutions

Have an idea for how to implement a feature or fix a bug? Great! Feel free to describe your approach in an issue:

- Explain the concept and reasoning
- Suggest algorithms or design patterns at a high level
- Describe the architecture or approach you have in mind

**Please keep suggestions conceptual** rather than providing detailed line-by-line pseudocode or complete implementations. Ideas and approaches are extremely valuable and welcome — the goal is to collaborate on *what* to build while keeping the *how* unencumbered by copyright concerns.

If you're proposing a solution because you'd like to see it in Codion, this is the way to make it happen!

## Translations

There’s plenty of localization work available for those interested.

For an overview of localizable messages, see the `technical/i18n` section in the documentation.

## Documentation Requests

The documentation is a work in progress. If something is unclear, missing, or needs improvement, feel free to open an issue — I’ll prioritize based on demand.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome — with a note of caution:

Codion is mostly feature-complete. Maintainers may be very selective about new feature inclusion to preserve its simplicity and focus. That said, good ideas are always worth discussing.

Thanks again for taking the time to explore Codion and help improve it.
