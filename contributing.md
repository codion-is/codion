# Contributing to Codion

Thank you for you wanting to contribute, here's what you need to know before proceeding.

## Code contributions

Codion may be dual-licenced at some point, so in order to accept code contributions I must require that contributors provide a copyright assignment. I have yet to set up the infrastructure for accepting copyright assignments, but I will do so when the need arises. 

## Bug reports

Bug reports are most welcome and appreciated, please specify the version of Codion you are using and be as detailed as possible. Please provide a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org) if at all possible.

## Translations

There is a lot of translation work available for those who are interested, for an overview of localized messages see the technical/i18n section of the documentation.

## Documentation requests

The Codion documentation is a work in progress, feel free to create issues requesting specific documentation improvements and/or additions.

## Feature requests

Feel free to request features but please be aware that I regard Codion as being mostly feature-complete so the feature request acceptance threshold may be very high.
