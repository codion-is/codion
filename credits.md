### Thomas Bierhance

- **Contribution**: Original author of `MaximumMatch` and `AutoCompletion`, refactored into Codion's `Completion` system (`is.codion.swing.common.ui.component.combobox`).
- **Status**: Included with express permission. Functionality significantly extended and tested.
- **Note**: Originally designed for basic completion behavior, the component has been modernized, bug-fixed, and backed by a full UI test harness — forming a cornerstone of Codion’s combo box UX.
