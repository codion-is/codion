-- This migration represents the initial schema
-- In a real application, this would be the starting point
-- For this demo, the schema is already created by create_schema.sql
-- So this migration just records that V1 is already applied

-- This migration is intentionally empty as the schema already exists
-- Future migrations will add to this base schema
