The {url-javadoc}/org/jminor/swing/framework/ui/EntityTablePanel.html[EntityTablePanel] provides a table view of entities.

== Adding a print action

The most common place to add a custom control is the table popup menu, i.e. an action for printing reports. The table popup menu is based on the ControlSet returned by the **getTablePopupControlSet()** method in the EntityPanel class which in turn uses the ControlSet returned by the **getPrintControls()** method in the same class for constructing the print popup submenu. So, to add a custom print action you override the **getPrintControls()** method and return a ControlSet containing the action.
