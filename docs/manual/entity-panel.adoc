The {url-javadoc}/org/jminor/swing/framework/ui/EntityPanel.html[EntityPanel] is the base UI class for working with entity instances. It usually consists of an {url-javadoc}/org/jminor/swing/framework/ui/EntityTablePanel.html[EntityTablePanel], an {url-javadoc}/org/jminor/swing/framework/ui/EntityEditPanel.html[EntityEditPanel], and a set of detail panels representing the entities having a master/detail relationship with the underlying entity.

== Detail panels

Adding a detail panel is done with a single method call, but note that the underlying EntityModel must contain the correct detail model for the detail panel, in this case a *CustomerModel* instance, see <<entity-model.adoc#_detail_models, detail models>>. See link:#_entityapplicationpanel[EntityApplicationPanel].
