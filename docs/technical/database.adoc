== Database layer

The JMinor database layer is extremely thin, it doesn't perform any joins and provides no access to DBMS specific funtionality except primary key generation via <<{basedir}/manual/manual.adoc#_keygenerator, KeyGenerator>> strategies. The framework provides implementations for the most common strategies, sequences (with or without triggers) and auto increment columns.
