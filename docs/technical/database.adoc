== Database layer

The JMinor database layer is extremely thin, it doesn't perform any joins and provides no access to DBMS specific funtionality except primary key generation via {url-javadoc}/org/jminor/framework/domain/Entity.KeyGenerator.html[KeyGenerator] strategies. The framework provides implementations for the most common strategies, sequences (with or without triggers) and auto increment columns.
