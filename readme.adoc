JMinor is a minimalistic full-stack Java rich client CRUD application framework based solely on J2SE components, it includes:

* Simple domain modelling in plain Java code.
* Integrated JUnit testing of the domain model.
* A minimal but complete JDBC abstraction layer.
* A straight forward and simple way of wiring together a rich Swing client on top of the domain model, all done in plain Java code.
* Clients are run with either a local JDBC connection or served by a featherweight RMI server.
* Integrated JasperReports support.
