Codion is a minimalistic full-stack Java rich client CRUD application framework based solely on link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Standard_Edition++[Java SE] components, it includes:

* Simple domain modelling in plain Java code.
* Integrated JUnit testing of the domain model.
* A minimal but complete JDBC abstraction layer.
* A straight forward and simple way of wiring together a rich Swing client on top of the domain model, all done in plain Java code.
* Clients are run with either a local JDBC connection or served by a featherweight RMI server.
* Integrated JasperReports support.
* ...and much more.

== Domain model
The domain model in Codion is based on concepts from entity relationship diagrams, *entities* and *properties*. Defining the domain model is done in plain Java code, no annotations or XML is involved. All domain models extend the Domain class,

We start by extending the *Domain* class, with a couple of convenient static imports (skipping the rest for brevity).

Then we define string constants for the entity and its properties (referred to as *entityIds* and *propertyIds*), which are used whenever we need to refer to the entity type and its properties.

And finally we define an entity using the *entityId* and *propertyIds*.

Integrated JUnit testing harness for the domain model.

== Database access

The *EntityConnection* interface defines the database layer. There are three implementations available; local, which is based on a direct JDBC connection (used below), RMI and HTTP which are both served by the Codion EntityServer.
